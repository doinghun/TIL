Highest to Lowest Specificity

1. Inline rules (Binary - `1` or `0`)
2. Number of id selectors
3. Number of class, pseudo-class & attribute selectors
4. Number of tags & pseudo-element selectors

- Specificity matrix order: [inline, id, class/pseudo-class/attribute, tag/pseudo-element]
- In cases of equal specificity, last rule is applied
